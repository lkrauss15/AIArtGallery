## Intro

Hey there!

This is a pretty basic app that allows for viewing a gallery of images. Created with React/node.js, I wanted it to be pretty minimal.
So, the UI is pretty simplistic, but I took some time to get it looking how I wanted it. I designed it specifically for AI generated images.

The sample images I included are some that I generated with [BigSleep AI](https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep). (Check it out, it's super cool!)

## Usage

This is a very simple node app. Run the following to spin up a server and view the gallery:

```bash
$ npm start
```
