## Intro

Hey there!

This is my website. I made it with Node.js (+ Express) and React. It has a little about me and links to some creations.

##AI Art Gallery
This section of my website is a simple gallery for viewing AI-generated images. I wanted it to be pretty minimal.
So, the UI is pretty simplistic, but I took some time to get it looking how I wanted it. I designed it specifically for AI generated images.


The sample images I included are some that I generated with [BigSleep AI](https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep). (Check it out, it's super cool!)

## Usage

This is a very simple node app. Run the following to build and spin up the website. 

```bash
$ npm start
```

Then, you can navigate to it at http://localhost:8080/.

That's it!
